# Face-Recognition-JS

> Face Recognition in Javascript.

# Goals ⛳️

- Detect faces in images.


# Overview

> This AI is able to recognize the name of every character in an image very quickly without much performance overhead. We will be using the Face API JS library built on Tensor Flow to setup the face recognition.

# Problem

- We want to build an ML system, that when given a specific input image, will tell us if a face in the input image is similar a face in our database.
